Welcome to the README for Shaun's Portfolio! This is currently a work in progress, that is being continually updated and amended as I learn new skills and complete new projects. 

Project #1 - Run Buddy: First course project, focus on HTML and CSS basics. GitHub repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/run-buddy

Project #2 - Horiseon: Second course project, focus on existing code refactor for HTML/CSS & overall functionality improvements. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/horiseon

First Professional Project - BSC: The first website I ever built (with the assistance of a rudimentary drag/drop builder). I built this site in 2013 for a previous employer that commissioned the project. I recently found the old source code and was surprised to find that it was mostly still functional!
