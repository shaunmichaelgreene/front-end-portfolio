**Course Project #3 - Robot Gladiators**: Third course project, focus on vanilla javascript only to develop a simple turn-based battle game using prompts, alerts, and console logs. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/robot-gladiators

**Course Project #4 - Password Generator**: Fourth course project, in-browser app with dynamically updated HTML & CSS powered by javascript. Users can generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/password-generator

**Course Project #5 - Taskinator**: Fifth course project, single-page application to organize your personal to-do list items by using a dropdown menu to change the task status and move the task into To Do, In Progress, and Completed lists. Focus on dynamically manipulatiing page behavior using Web APIs and the DOM. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/taskinator

**Course Project #6 - Coding Quiz**: Multi-page browser app with timer-based coding quiz that stores high scores using client-side storage. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/coding-quiz

**Course Project #7 - Taskmaster Pro**: Refactor of an existing codebase, which was built using jQuery, a third-party JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, and the front-end CSS library Bootstrap. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/taskmaster-pro

**Course Project #8 - Work-Day Scheduler**: Eighth course project, calendar app that lets users schedule events for each hour of the day. Focus on 3rd-party libraries such as Bootstrap, jQuery, Moment.JS and CDNs. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/work-day-scheduler

**Course Project #9 - Git-It-Done**: Web app that uses GitHub's API to search for open source projects with open issues and pull requests. JavaScript retrieves and displays repositories with their open issue counts when a user searches for them. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/git-it-done

**Course Project #10 - Weather Dashboard**: Application that allows users to search for a city and find its current and forecasted weather conditions. Uses server-side API requests to fetch & parse data, handle responses, and dynamically generate HTML content. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/weather-dashboard

**Group Project #1 - Nature-Finder**: First group project. HTML, CSS, and JS blended with multiple 3rd-party and server-side APIs to develop a simple search application to retrieve info on local points of interest (parks, trails, landmarks, etc). GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/nature-finder

**First Professional Project - BSC**: The first website I ever built (with the assistance of a rudimentary drag/drop builder). I built this site in 2013 for a previous employer that commissioned the project. I recently found the old source code and was surprised to find that it was mostly still functional!
