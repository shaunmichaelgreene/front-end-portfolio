Welcome to the README for Shaun's Portfolio! This was my front end portfolio that I continually updated and amended as I learned new skills and completed new projects during a full stack certification course. This was built from scratch using HTML, custom CSS, javascript, and a few bootstrap elements.

**Course Project #4 - Password Generator**: Fourth course project, in-browser app with dynamically updated HTML & CSS powered by javascript. Users can generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/password-generator

**Course Project #5 - Taskinator**: Fifth course project, single-page application to organize your personal to-do list items by using a dropdown menu to change the task status and move the task into To Do, In Progress, and Completed lists. Focus on dynamically manipulatiing page behavior using Web APIs and the DOM. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/taskinator

**Course Project #6 - Coding Quiz**: Multi-page browser app with timer-based coding quiz that stores high scores using client-side storage. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/coding-quiz

**Course Project #7 - Taskmaster Pro**: Refactor of an existing codebase, which was built using jQuery, a third-party JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, and the front-end CSS library Bootstrap. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/taskmaster-pro

**Course Project #8 - Work-Day Scheduler**: Eighth course project, calendar app that lets users schedule events for each hour of the day. Focus on 3rd-party libraries such as Bootstrap, jQuery, Moment.JS and CDNs. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/work-day-scheduler

**Course Project #9 - Git-It-Done**: Web app that uses GitHub's API to search for open source projects with open issues and pull requests. JavaScript retrieves and displays repositories with their open issue counts when a user searches for them. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/git-it-done

**Course Project #10 - Weather Dashboard**: Application that allows users to search for a city and find its current and forecasted weather conditions. Uses server-side API requests to fetch & parse data, handle responses, and dynamically generate HTML content. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/weather-dashboard

**Group Project #1 - Nature-Finder**: First group project. HTML, CSS, and JS blended with multiple 3rd-party and server-side APIs to develop a simple search application to retrieve info on local points of interest (parks, trails, landmarks, etc). GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/nature-finder

**Course Project #11 - Portfolio Generator**: Interactive application that built with Node.js CLI that dynamically generates an HTML portfolio using input that the user enters when prompted. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/portfolio-generator

**Course Project #12 - README Generator**: An intuitive Node.js command line application that receives user input about a new project and generates a professional README file in Markdown format. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/readme-generator

**Course Project #13 - Jest Another RPG**: A command-line role-playing game (RPG) in which the user battles against a series of enemies whose health and stats can be sustained by taking a potion. The game creates new objects using JavaScript constructor functions, and also implements basic code tests using the Jest framework. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/jest-another-rpg

**Course Project #14 - Team Profile Generator**: A unique node.JS app that uses object-oriented-programming and that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/team-profile-generator

**Course Project #15 - Zookeepr**: A zoo database application that features a web server built using the Express.js framework, added to a front-end application, and deployed live with Heroku. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/zookeepr

**Course Project #16 - Note Taker**: Primarily a server-side app that allows users to write and save notes. The front end has been tied to the back end using Express.js to save/retrieve note data with a JSON file. The application is also deployed live to Heroku, making it easy for the user to keep track of their notes and tasks across multiple sessions. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/note-taker

**Course Project #17 - E-Commerce Back-End**: A relatively simple back-end for an e-commerce site created with Node.js by taking a functional Express API and using the Sequelize ORM library to interact with a MySQL database. Users can interact with the database using CRUD methods to view, create, update, and delete products, product categories, and product tags. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/e-commerce-back-end

**Course Project #18 - Tech Blog**: A completely full-stack CMS-style blog website! Users can log in, publish posts, and add comments to other posts. This app was built entirely from scratch and deployed like with Heroku. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/tech-blog

**Group Project #2 - The Last Word**: Second group project. First collaborative full-tack application. Message board based game that encourages lengthy civil arguments that are decided through a battle of attrition. He or She who yells the loudest and the longest shall prevail! Users can post a topic for for others to discuss via comments, and whoever has the last word wins the argument! If a post or comment does not receive a comment reply within 24 hours, the post will lock and the most recent poster/commenter will win The Last Word award. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shaunmichaelgreene/the-last-word

**First Professional Project - BSC**: The first website I ever built (with the assistance of a rudimentary drag/drop builder). I built this site in 2013 for a previous employer that commissioned the project. I recently found the old source code and was surprised to find that it was mostly still functional!
